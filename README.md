2. [Install Firefox Nightly for Android in your phone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.fenix&hl=en_US&gl=US)
3. Connect your phone to your computer via USB
4. [Follow these steps in order to setup your phone and browser to install the addon](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/developing-extensions-for-firefox-for-android/#set-up-your-computer-and-android-emulator-or-device) 
5. You might need to execute `adb shell pm grant org.mozilla.fenix android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` in your terminal so the addon could be pushed to your phone
6. Execute `adb devices` in your terminal, copy the device id, and replace the string `<device id from adb devices>` on package.json by it
7. Execute `npm run android -- --android-device=<ANDROID_DEVICE_ID>` in your terminal to install the addon in your phone and have the browser automatically started (or `npm run android-win -- --android-device=<ANDROID_DEVICE_ID>` if developing on a Windows system) 

That should be enough to have the addon installed on Firefox in your Android. Folow the steps in the video below to learn how to use it.

## Development

### 3rd party dependencies

The extension does not utilize any npm modules, and the only vendored dependencies within are:

- Bergamot Translator

    - A WebAssembly wrapper around the actual Neural Machine Translator, [Marian](https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian-dev/). The code to build the WASM module can be found on its [repository](https://github.com/mozilla/bergamot-translator#build-wasm)

- Fasttext
    - We bundle the WebAssembly port of fasttext along its [compressed model](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/language-identification.html) in order to detect the page's language. Instructions to build the WebAssembly module can be [found here](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/webassembly-module.html)

- Sentry
    - We bundle [Sentry Javascript's SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript) for error reporting.

- serialize-error
  - code of [serialize-error npm package](https://github.com/sindresorhus/serialize-error) is bundled for serialization of exceptions to
    report errors from content scripts to background script

### How to run
- Install Firefox Nightly
- Clone this repo and run `npm install`
- Run `npm run once` and wait until Nightly starts
- Go to `about:config` and set `extensions.experiments.enabled` to true
- Browse to a page in any of the [supported languages](#supported-languages) to have the translation option to appear


### Updating telemetry schema

After adding new metrics to `extension/model/telemetry/metrics.yaml` or pings to `extension/model/telemetry/pings.yaml`, run
```
bash scripts/update-telemetry-schema.sh
```
to regenerate JS telemetry schema.

### Updating bergamot-translator WASM module

Replace
- `extension/controller/translation/bergamot-translation-worker.js`
- `extension/model/static/translation/bergamot-translator-worker.wasm`

with the new artifacts and then execute:

```
bash scripts/update-bergamot-translator.sh
```

to regenerate JS version file. This version is reported in telemetry.
