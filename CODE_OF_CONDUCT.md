## How to Report

For more information on how to report violations of the Community Participation Guidelines, please read our '[How to Report](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/reporting/)' page.

## Etiquette

- No abusing people. Constant and intense critique is one of the reasons we build great products. It's harder to fall into group-think if there is always a healthy amount of dissent. We want to encourage vibrant debate inside of the Mozilla community, we want you to disagree with us, and we want you to effectively argue your case. However, we require that in the process, you criticize things, not people. Examples of things include: interfaces, algorithms, and schedules. Examples of people include: developers, designers, and users. Attacking or encouraging attacks on a person may result in you being banned from the repo.

- No obligation. "Open Source" is not the same as "the developers must do my bidding." Everyone here wants to help, but no one else has any obligation to fix the bugs you want fixed. Therefore, you should not act as if you expect someone to fix a bug by a particular date or release. Aggressive or repeated demands will not be received well and will almost certainly diminish the impact of and interest in your suggestions.

- No pointless comments. Limit comments on a bug to information which will help with resolving it.

- No private email. Do not send comments on bugs by private email to the maintainers; no one else can read them if you do that, and they at risk of not being considered.
